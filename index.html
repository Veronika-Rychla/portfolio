            I'm a geeky person who loves learning and needs to be constantly
            creating something. I was always curious about technology and had my
            first attempts at coding way back at grammar school when I created
            several webpages for my pet projects. I'm really excited to return
            to this fascinating field that's always changing so that I can learn
            something new every day.

                I studied archaeology and English philology at Silesian
                University and continued to study English and American
                Literature at Palacky University. During my PhD studies, I
                started to teach English and even though I enjoyed it, I felt it
                wasn't really for me so I quit. I was selling videogames for one
                sweet year (yes, I'm an avid gamer!) but then it was time to
                move on with my career so I relocated to Prague.

                I've always wanted to try being a librarian and that dream came
                true eventually when I became a librarian at a private British
                school. I loved it, however, I soon discovered how repetitite
                the job is and I'm a person who loves learning and creating.

                I was considering a career change and wasn't sure which way to
                go. I'm also a part-time copywriter but I can't imagine myself
                doing it for eight hours a day. My brother is a JavaScript
                programmer who always looks very happy about his job and if he
                could learn front-end from the scratch in his free time, why
                couldn't I? I discovered Czechitas at the right time, applied
                for their Digital Academy: Web course and got in! And I think it
                was one of my best decisions ever.

            Japanglish: Trip to Tokyo is an educative visual novel that teaches
            Japanglish words to English speakers. As any other visual novel, our
            game mainly focuses on a story and dialogues. As the story
            progresses, a player gets tested on a variety of Japanglish words
            that naturally appear in a conversation. The happiness metre shows
            how successful you are at guessing their meanings. Should the hearts
            drop to zero, it's a game over and you have to start again. The game
            has several locations, each consisting of a unique set of test
            vocabulary connected to a certain place such as a train station,
            school, café, restaurant, shopping centre and home.
