# How to use this portfolio

Even though this is my personal portfolio, it's easy and ready to use as a template for your own presentation. Simply fork this respository or manually copy these files: index.html, style.css and index.js. You don't need to copy the images folder since you'll be using your own assets anyway.

# Colours

Colours are set in style.css as CSS variables. Changing these variables to any colour of your choosing will result in the whole webpage changing colours.

# Dark mode

There's a dark mode/light mode switch implemented. The styles can be found in style.css under "Dark mode switch" commentary, the technical part is done using JavaScript in index.js. If you don't want to use this functionality, simply delete the respective code in the header of index.html.

# Hamburger menu

The menu in this portfolio is responsive. Should a user access the page from their mobile phone, the menu transforms into a hamburger menu. The animation is done in style.css under "Hamburger menu" commentary, the functional part can be found in index.js under the same heading.

# Carousel

It's possible to display your pictures as a carousel gallery. Insert all your pictures in index.html and JavaScript takes care of creating an array out of the pictures provided and generating navigation buttons.
